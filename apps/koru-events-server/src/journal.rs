//! The journal: `events.db`, and everything that is true about a stored event.
//!
//! **Pragmas are the cache profile; schema versioning is the durable
//! convention — a deliberate hybrid.** WAL + `synchronous = NORMAL`, because
//! events are observations rather than user content: a tail lost to a power
//! cut is ADR-101's "stale, never wrong" case — domain events re-derive from
//! store state, and a client send that never got its receipt retries under
//! the same `event_id` and dedupes. But schema changes *migrate* (forward-only
//! steps, `user_version`, refuse-newer) rather than drop-and-rebuild, because
//! client-originated rows cannot be reconstructed from any source.
//!
//! **A sequence is never reused.** `seq` is `AUTOINCREMENT`, which is
//! load-bearing: pruning old rows must not re-issue a number under a live
//! subscriber's cursor. Do not "simplify" it away —
//! `pruning_never_reuses_a_sequence` is the test that says so.
//!
//! **Nothing here runs on a timer.** Retention is enforced amortized on the
//! write path — every [`PRUNE_CHECK_EVERY`] appends — so the cost lands on
//! the writer that caused it and an idle journal costs nothing.
