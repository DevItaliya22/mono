//! **What the tasks milestone costs on the desktop side** — plan P-Base
//! (roadmap rev6 §5), cases §6 (c) and (d).
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --release -p koru --bin koru tasks_view::perf -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d, on the same argument the other two baselines in this plan
//! carry: the runs below build pages of five thousand rows and type twelve
//! hundred characters, which is a minute nobody working on something else should
//! pay. The **structural** claims already run unignored — `apps/koru/src/perf.rs`
//! for the edit path, `tasks_view/tests.rs` for a page that lays out only its
//! visible band, `mainview/tests.rs` for the rollover — and this adds only the
//! arithmetic they deliberately refuse to carry.
//!
//! ## What "5,000" can and cannot mean in this process
//!
//! It matters, because the roadmap's phrasing and this window's architecture do
//! not line up, and quietly measuring the wrong thing would be worse than saying
//! so. **A page is a page**: `koru_store_wire::tasks::DEFAULT_LIMIT` is 100 and
//! `MAX_LIMIT` is 500, so no `TasksView` in a shipped build ever holds five
//! thousand rows — the store answers a page and the corpus stays in the store.
//! And after [ADR-90] one `WorkspaceDoc` is one *document*, so five thousand
//! tasks scattered over two hundred and fifty documents cannot be in the
//! document a person is typing in either.
//!
//! So each case below is measured at the size it can actually reach, and one
//! synthetic oversize run is included to show the *shape*:
//!
//! - **(d) the view** at 100 and 500 rows — the two page sizes that ship — and at
//!   5,000, which is not a page any store will send but is what says the view's
//!   own layout is linear rather than accidentally quadratic.
//! - **(c) typing** in two models, because the honest one is not the obvious one.
//!   *Model A* is the container's real per-keystroke work: a Tasks tab holding a
//!   full page, `adopt`ed on every press exactly as `App::adopt_others` does it,
//!   against no such tab. *Model B* is the harshest local version: typing in a
//!   document that itself holds many task rows, which is where E-4's due chip and
//!   T-0b's edit noting are actually on the edit path.
//!
//! ## The ratios are gates now
//!
//! **Approved by the owner on 2026-09-01**, as proposed (`PERF_BASELINE.md` §7).
//! Two of the four numbers here were already asserted at the value the report
//! went on to propose — the frame's exponent and the open path's — because their
//! margins were wide enough that a second, looser ceiling above them would have
//! meant nothing. The other two were loose and are now the approved figures: the
//! paired typing ratio at 1.30 and the task-premium exponent at 0.5. One is new:
//! opening at 500 rows against opening at 100, which is the only shipped-size
//! comparison in the file and had no assertion at all.
//!
//! **Nothing here was touched by `attrs_probe`.** These cases feed the view a
//! synthetic `TaskQueryResponse` and never reach a store, which is what makes
//! them the client's numbers rather than the sum of both sides. The store's half
//! of a Tasks-tab open fell 830 ms -> 43 ms with the index; this half was 1.6 ms
//! before and is 1.6 ms after, and that is the point of measuring them apart.
//!
