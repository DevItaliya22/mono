//! **The Canvases section** — Explore's seventh mode (CANVAS P1.3).
//!
//! Every canvas in the workspace, as **one flat list**: the manifest's
//! [`KIND_CANVAS`] entries in manifest order, each a row at depth zero with no
//! caret. A canvas holds no pages, so there is nothing to nest under one; and a
//! canvas somebody nested under a page elsewhere is still listed here, flat,
//! because this section is the one place a person looks for canvases.
//!
//! A row is a `Kind::Document` row in every way the pane's machinery asks: a
//! click opens it (the container builds a canvas tab from its kind), F2 and the
//! row menu rename it, a drag carries it to a pane or to the Trash. What it is
//! **never** is reordered or nested — the drop a drag inside the list would
//! make is refused, so the carried row eases back to where it was. The order is
//! the manifest's, and nobody arranges it.
//!
//! A child module, like `rail` and `actions`, so the section's rules are one
//! file rather than a few more arms in the pane's 7,000 lines.
