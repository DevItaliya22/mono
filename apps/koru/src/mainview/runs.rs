//! **The run tabs' pass**, and the four things a run view asks this window
//! for.
//!
//! `koru-runs-ui` reads a run through `/v1/runs` on a thread of its own and
//! draws it. What it cannot do is anything that needs this window's session
//! connection: asking the agent for the controller, giving it back, and
//! opening the session tab the person types in. All three are one
//! connection's business, because a controller lease belongs to the
//! connection holding it — a surface that opened a second one would be this
//! window competing with itself (§7.4, ADR-341). The fourth is a tab: a run
//! view names a result and this window opens it (ADR-368), because which
//! tab strip a document lands in was never a run view's to decide.
//!
//! **Nothing here reaches a run.** The listing behind the Agents
//! navigator's *Runs* group is `koru_runs_ui::RunIndex`, which is another
//! thread; this file drains what those threads said and pushes in the
//! things only a window knows — the language, the clock, who is rating,
//! what the devices are called, and where the session handover stands.
