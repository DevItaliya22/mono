//! **A canvas's chain, run from this window** (CANVAS M5, P5.2–P5.3), and an
//! agent node run on its own (UC10).
//!
//! A person presses Run on a start node. The chain it reaches
//! (`koru_canvas_flow::chain_from`) runs a step at a time: an agent node starts
//! once everything upstream of it has a result, given the cards, images and
//! upstream agent nodes connected into it; its result is **copied into the
//! node** (Q18), so it syncs and becomes the next node's input; an output node
//! writes a page from what reaches it (P5.3). A step that fails, is stopped or
//! finishes with nothing stops what depends on it and says why (Q21, as the
//! planner builds it — CANVAS Q-8). Stop marks the rest *not started*.
//!
//! **The canvas is the state.** A press records a fresh id — an *execution* —
//! and this device on the start node; each agent node's run link and each
//! output's page link carry the execution they belong to
//! (`koru.start.execution`, `koru.start.device`, `koru.step.execution`), and
//! the start's id is cleared when the execution ends. What this module holds
//! is derived from those and from the runs, so a window that opens a canvas
//! whose chain it began before, on this device, continues it
//! ([`MainView::reconcile_canvas`]); any other device leaves it alone.
//!
//! **Everything is read and written through the store, as another writer, on
//! a worker.** [`ChainPort::edit`] joins the canvas's room with a replica of
//! its own (`koru_workspace::edit_foreign_document`), writes, waits until the
//! store has the write on its disk, and answers with what the canvas then
//! holds. So a copied result never enters the person's Ctrl+Z, the window
//! thread never waits on a store, and a step that starts after an upstream
//! copy pins a canvas that already holds it: the copy is durable before the
//! next run's context is captured. Edits to one canvas go out one at a time,
//! so every answer has seen every write before it.
//!
//! **The planner is `koru-canvas-flow`'s**, asked again whenever a step moves;
//! the runs are [`CanvasRuns`]', whose updates `maintain_canvas_runs` hands
//! here. Every word a node shows is `koru-i18n`'s — a run's through
//! `koru_runs_ui::summary`, the chain's own through its `CanvasChain*` rows.
//!
//! **The canvas surface is the caller, and it lands on its own branch.** Until
//! it calls [`MainView::run_chain`] and the rest, only this module's tests do,
//! so the build would call most of it dead; the allow below says so once and
//! goes when the surface is wired.
