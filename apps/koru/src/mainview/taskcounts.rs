//! What the tasks rail's numbers come from.
//!
//! The rail draws five bucket counts, a per-list count and the overdue share of
//! each. None of that is knowable from the open document: a task is a marked
//! node anywhere in the workspace, and the answer is the store's read model. So
//! this is the adapter - **one refresh, two statements, on a worker thread,
//! never on the event thread** - with the answer stamped so a stale one is
//! discarded rather than drawn.
//!
//! It is `HistoryPanel`'s shape, deliberately: a cached client, a generation, a
//! one-shot thread per unit of work, and a deadline that is `None` while the
//! surface is hidden - so a window whose sidebar is showing documents makes no
//! task traffic at all.
//!
//! ## Two statements, and neither of them counts a page
//!
//! `group_by: "bucket"` answers five corpus-wide rows - one per agenda bucket,
//! with the overdue share of each - and `group_by: "list"` answers one per list.
//! Both are counts over the whole matching set rather than over the page, so
//! **both queries ask for one row and read none of it**: `limit: 1` is not a
//! sample, it is a statement that the rows are not what was wanted.
//!
//! **This used to fold the buckets here, and it was wrong twice.** The open page
//! was fetched at `MAX_LIMIT` and bucketed client-side, so every count was a
//! *floor* past five hundred tasks (`capped`, drawn `500+`); and the local copy
//! of the rule had no thirty-day horizon, so every dated task past next week
//! counted as *Upcoming* and *Later* held nothing but undated work. R-1b put
//! bucketing in the store - where `bucket_placement_agrees_with_the_domain_function`
//! holds it equal to `koru_core::tasks::bucket` over a five-thousand-task
//! corpus - and this asks for it instead. `capped` is now always `false`, and
//! stays in [`TaskCounts`] because it is the honest thing to say the day a
//! count comes off a page again.
//!
//! The windows the store compares against are the reader's, computed once in
//! [`crate::tasks_view::query::windows_now`] and shared with the Tasks tab - so
//! *today* means one thing in the window rather than two.
