//! **Koru's conformance adapter for `koru-app-shell`. `#[cfg(test)]`, so none
//! of it ships.**
//!
//! `MainView` hosted as **one** shell surface, per ADR-262. It is the compiler's
//! answer to "does the shipped boundary carry a Koru tab", and the answer it
//! gives is a specific one:
//!
//! **It can, because the adapter owns the domain and the boundary never sees
//! it.** `View::key`, `View::mouse_down`, `View::adopt` and `View::reseat` all
//! take a live `&mut WorkspaceDoc`. A shell forbidden from naming `koru-core`
//! could never pass one — and does not have to, because a `Surface` method
//! takes only `&mut self`. The workspace lives *inside* this adapter, beside
//! the `MainView` that borrows it. That is exactly ADR-262's conclusion
//! ("`MainView` remains Koru's one host surface … Koru's domain tab dispatch,
//! workspace borrowing and restoration never leave `apps/koru`") turned into
//! something that either compiles or does not.
//!
//! **This is not the delegation.** SP-14 makes `MainView` the shell's surface in
//! the running product; what is here is the seam, kept compiled and kept
//! exercised so the boundary cannot drift away from its one Koru consumer in
//! between. The seam this app gains is a `#[cfg(test)] mod` line and nothing
//! else — `koru-app-shell` is already a real dependency for the tab manager.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately *not* here
//!
//! `View::restore`, `View::capture` and `View::on_workspace_switched` take
//! `&Workspace` and `&Settings`. They are not on the boundary and must not be:
//! the minimal contract forbids payload persistence and restoration hooks, and
//! a workspace switch is the host reseating its own surface after a banner
//! selection, not something the shell performs. This file drives them
//! **around** the boundary, which is what proves they still work when the shell
//! knows nothing about them.
