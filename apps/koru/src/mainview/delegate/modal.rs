//! The delegation modal's state — four fields, one grant, one focus ring.
//!
//! D9's four things (objective, agent, working scope, context) and D28's
//! grant, with **no geometry and no drawing**: this file answers *what is
//! true* and `super::paint` answers *where it is on screen*. That split is
//! what lets every behavioural test in `super::tests` drive the surface
//! without a window, and it is why the focus ring is a `Vec<Hit>` rebuilt on
//! demand rather than a set of rectangles.
//!
//! **Nothing here touches disk, a store or the network.** Opening it, typing
//! into it and moving around it are pure changes to this struct; the one thing
//! that reaches the world is `Outcome::Delegate`, which the container performs
//! on a worker thread (`super::job`).
