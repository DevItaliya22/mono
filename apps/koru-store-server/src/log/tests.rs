//! **Our wiring, not the appender's behaviour.**
//!
//! Rotation and retention are `tracing-appender`'s contract — which file a date
//! maps to, when a new one begins, how many survive. Re-testing those would be
//! testing somebody else's library through ours, and the test would keep
//! passing after we stopped calling it correctly.
//!
//! What is ours: that both launch modes retain a file, and that the guard is
//! returned rather than dropped.
