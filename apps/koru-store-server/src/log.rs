//! Where the daemon's output goes.
//!
//! A console daemon prints and retains the same records in a file. A tray
//! daemon has nowhere to print, so it writes only to that file — and the moment
//! there is a file there is a question about
//! how long it grows for, which is the question this module answers by **not
//! answering it**: `tracing-appender` rolls daily and keeps seven files, and
//! none of that logic is ours.
//!
//! ```text
//! <store root>/logs/koru-store-server.log.2026-08-09
//! ```
//!
//! Under the channel's root rather than beside the executable, which may be in
//! Program Files and unwritable — and per-channel, so a nightly store's log
//! cannot be mistaken for a stable one's.
//!
//! ## Why `tracing` and not a `log` facade
//!
//! Because of where this goes next. A cloud deployment adds an exporter —
//! `tracing-opentelemetry`, or a vendor's layer — as **one more layer in this
//! same initialiser**, behind a cargo feature, with no change at any call site.
//! `log4rs` and `flexi_logger` both rotate perfectly well and neither has that
//! shape. That layer and that feature are deliberately not added now.
//!
//! The process-level machinery lives in the leaf `koru-log` crate and is shared
//! with `koru-mcp`; `koru-store-core` still does not inherit it. A mobile build
//! embeds core, and a logging framework is not something an embedder should
//! inherit.
//!
//! ## Two process concerns
//!
//! **The shared panic hook** sends a panic through tracing before delegating to
//! Rust's previous hook. A `windows_subsystem = "windows"` process otherwise
//! disappears without a console record.
//!
//! **A message box on a fatal start-up failure**, because before the store is
//! serving there is no tray either. Without it, "I double-clicked it and nothing
//! happened" is the entire user experience of a bad database.
