//! Five things are composed and nothing else is invented:
//!
//! - **The walk** reads `projection.db` — its own connection, the same
//!   sweep-first discipline as the attribute and task ports — and hands the
//!   rows to `koru-blob-sync`'s one canonical rule. The read model does not
//!   get a second copy of the rule and this file does not get one either.
//! - **The Store port** is the existing `Store` surface: `verify_blob`,
//!   `begin_blob_upload`/`finish_blob_upload`, `blob`. The download's object
//!   is published *before* its association because that is what those two
//!   calls do in that order, and they are in one port method so a caller
//!   cannot reverse them.
//! - **The account** arrives over control 7 and is read per pass, never
//!   cached: a token expires and an account is switched while a transfer runs.
//! - **The announcement** wakes whatever is waiting for that picture. On this
//!   platform the thing waiting is the window's own pending `GET`, because
//!   that request already blocks on hydration — so a blob a background pass
//!   fetched completes a request the window made for its own reasons, and the
//!   picture appears without a second round trip.
//! - **The triggers** are §10's, and the one that fires most often —
//!   a durable document change — is gated on the hash set having actually
//!   moved, inside the engine, before this file is entered.
