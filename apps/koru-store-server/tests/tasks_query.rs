//! **The tasks query, asked the way a Tasks view asks it** — R-1 (roadmap rev6
//! §5): freshness, page boundaries, and the deterministic performance
//! assertions §6 puts store-side.
//!
//! `tasks.rs` is the vertical slice: one task, every semantic. This one is
//! about the *reading* of a list — what a client is told when a workspace
//! cannot be answered for, what happens to a page boundary when the list moves
//! under it, and what a query costs when nothing has changed. All three are
//! asserted through the public route, because all three are promises to a
//! client rather than facts about a table; the same properties over a large
//! corpus are pinned in `koru-projection`, against `crate::fixtures`, where a
//! corpus can be built without publishing fifty-five thousand rows through a
//! sync session.
//!
//! **Structure, never a wall clock.** The counters say how many documents the
//! projector walked and how many rows the port answered; a millisecond would
//! say what this machine was doing at the time.
