//! **A supervised gateway child, for every suite that needs one.**
//!
//! The five gateway integration suites — `gateway_sync`, `gateway_ai`,
//! `gateway_settings`, `gateway_catalog_events`, `gateway_host_parity` — used
//! to spawn `koru-api-gateway.exe --root <root>` and wait for discovery. That
//! binary is gone. The only image that hosts the Gateway now is
//! `koru-agent.exe --worker gateway`, and that role is **supervised-only**: it
//! reads one newline-terminated `LaunchBootstrap` from stdin, proves the
//! bootstrap's channel, its root fingerprint and *this image's* fingerprint,
//! and connects the Agent's private bridge before it publishes anything. So a
//! suite that wants a gateway now has to play the Agent, and this module is
//! that harness — one copy, because five copies of a bootstrap writer is five
//! places for a launch contract to drift.
//!
//! A directory under `tests/` is not itself a test target, which is what makes
//! `mod gateway_process;` the supported way to share code between integration
//! test binaries. Each binary compiles its own copy and uses the part it needs;
//! `dead_code` is allowed here for exactly that reason.
//!
//! ## What a caller gets
//!
//! - [`Gateway::start`] and [`Gateway::start_with`] — spawn on a root, with any
//!   extra role arguments (`gateway_ai` passes `--deterministic-ai-test`), and
//!   write the bootstrap.
//! - [`Gateway::published`] — the readiness wait, answering with the
//!   `GatewayHello` the old fixtures returned. The caller supplies its own
//!   [`ClientHello`], so a failure still names the suite that opened the
//!   connection.
//! - [`Gateway::terminate`] — **kill and reap**, not a graceful stop. Several
//!   cases kill the gateway deliberately to prove what an acknowledgement
//!   meant; a polite stop would let it finish work it had already called
//!   durable, which is the one thing those assertions must not depend on.
//! - [`Drop`] — kills, reaps, and closes the harness bridge, so the next
//!   gateway on the same root binds a released rendezvous.
//!
//! ## Every child runs on its own root, and nothing machine-wide
//!
//! Endpoint names carry a digest of the root, so these children never meet each
//! other or the gateway a developer has open. Nothing here writes to
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
