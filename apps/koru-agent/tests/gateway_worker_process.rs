//! **Real `koru-agent.exe --worker gateway` children.** Every case here spawns
//! the shipped Agent image as a worker and asserts what a supervisor would see:
//! the exit code, what it said on stderr, whether it served, and what it did
//! *not* touch.
//!
//! ## Why a process suite and not a unit test
//!
//! The thing under test is an ordering inside `main` and a pipe between two
//! processes. `dispatch` running before the Agent's CLI, its log sink, its
//! single-instance claim, its tray, its global chord and dev's Windows
//! notification-identity self-restart is not a property any type holds — it is
//! a property of where one call sits, and the only honest proof that a worker
//! child never half-becomes an Agent is a worker child that did not. The
//! textual half of that ordering is pinned beside the role, in
//! `src/gateway_worker/tests.rs`; this file is the behavioural half.
//!
//! ## Every child runs on its own temporary root
//!
//! A rooted Agent takes nothing machine-wide, and every endpoint name carries a
//! digest of the root, so these children never meet each other or the gateway a
//! developer has open. Nothing here writes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
//!
//! ## The harness plays the Agent
//!
//! A supervised gateway registers over the private, root-qualified bridge
//! before it becomes discoverable, and refuses to start without one. So the
//! harness binds `koru_ipc::AGENT_GATEWAY_BRIDGE` under the test root, answers
//! one `Registration` with the real `BridgeAuthority`, and holds the connection
//! open — which is also what makes the bootstrap's capability, its channel, its
//! root fingerprint and **the fingerprint of this exact image** meaningful
//! rather than decorative.
//!
//! That harness started here and is now [`gateway_process`], shared with the
//! five gateway integration suites that came into this package when the
//! standalone `koru-api-gateway.exe` was retired. **What stays local is the
//! part it cannot serve**: the cases below hand the child a bootstrap that is
//! deliberately wrong, or no bootstrap at all, so they spawn by hand and never
//! reach a running gateway.
//!
//! Plan 4 is what puts a real `WorkerSpec` on the Agent's side. This suite
//! proves the child is possible and provable without one.
