//! ## `--root` isolates everything, or the suite edits the developer's machine
//!
//! An explicit root is how the gate runs several agents at once. Every
//! machine-wide thing the agent touches has to be redirected under it or turned
//! off — otherwise a `cargo test` run rewrites the global shortcut, adds a
//! Run-key entry and puts icons in the notification area of whoever ran it.
//!
//! | under an explicit `--root` | |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | the agent's own endpoint | a digest of the root appended, by `koru-ipc` |
//! | the store it ensures | the same root passed through |
//! | `device.json` | `<root>/agent/`, never `%LOCALAPPDATA%` |
//! | `search.conf` | `<root>/agent/`, never `%LOCALAPPDATA%` |
//! | reminder ledger/native namespace | ledger under `<root>/agent/`; OS ids use only a stable root hash |
//! | `DesktopPreferences` | `<root>/agent/`, never `%APPDATA%` |
//! | session profiles and attachments | `<root>/agent/sessions/` |
//! | global input | **not registered unless interactive `--tray` is explicitly requested** |
//! | the tray icon | **not created unless `--tray` is explicitly requested** |
//! | start-on-login | **refused** |
//!
//! Global chords and the Run entry are machine-wide. A headless test root never
//! registers either. The interactive `--tray` opt-in also enables global input;
//! `RegisterHotKey` safely refuses chords another process owns. Start-at-login
//! remains refused because its one Run value cannot be root-isolated. Tray icons
//! can coexist, but a notification area filling with icons during a test run is
//! its own answer, so a rooted agent still needs the explicit opt-in.
//!
//! **This is a decision about a *root*, not about `cfg(test)`.** A developer who
//! passes `--root` by hand gets the same isolation, which is what makes the
//! escape hatch usable rather than a way to half-clobber your own machine.
