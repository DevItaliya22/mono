//! read, so a flag cannot be accepted without being documented or documented
//! without being accepted. An unknown argument names itself, suggests the

//!
//! Ignoring an unrecognised argument sounds harmless and is the same failure as
//! guessing a directory. Here it is worse than usual: a mistyped `--root` would
//! silently operate on the *channel's own* root, including its data and startup
//! registration. An interactive rooted `--tray` launch may deliberately opt
//! into global input, but it still must not touch the ordinary installation.
//!
//! **The strictness has teeth in the other direction too.** The updater restarts
//! this binary with `--update-health-token <token>`, so a flag missing from the
//! table below is not a cosmetic gap: the agent would exit 2 on its first
//! launch, the updater would see the process it was waiting on gone, and a
//! perfectly good install would roll back. Anything that will ever restart the
