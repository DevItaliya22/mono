//! One shell's socket: a reader thread, and a writer with a queue.
//!
//! ## The event loop performs no blocking IPC, in either direction
//!
//! This is the load-bearing rule of the whole agent, and the reason a
//! connection is two threads rather than a socket the loop reads when it feels
//! like it.
//!
//! **A named pipe blocks when the peer stops reading.** So a shell that hangs —
//! or is being debugged, or is paging back in after the machine slept — would
//! otherwise freeze the tray, the hotkey, the overlay and every *other* shell's
//! routing, from inside a `write_all` the loop is sitting in. The failure is
//! total and it looks like the agent has crashed.
//!
//! So:
//!
//! - the **reader** parks on `read_exact` forever and raises what arrives. No
//!   timeout: an idle shell is idle on purpose, and a deadline there would turn
//!   quiet into a disconnection;
//! - the **writer** owns a queue. The loop calls [`Connection::send`], which
//!   pushes and returns. Nothing it does can wait on a peer.
//!
//! `interprocess`'s `Stream::split` gives a `RecvHalf` and a `SendHalf` that are
//! both `Send`, which is what makes this possible at all.
//!
//! ## EOF is the only disconnect signal
//!
//! No heartbeat and no liveness poll. The reader thread ending — clean close,
//! crash, or kill — raises [`AgentEvent::ShellGone`], which is the same argument
//! the rendezvous makes about liveness: you cannot read from a socket nobody is
//! holding. A failed *write* raises it too, because a socket that will not take
//! a byte is one nobody is holding either, and the routing decision has to be
//! made again rather than the result being lost into it.
