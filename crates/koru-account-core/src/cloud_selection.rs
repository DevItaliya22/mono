//! Bounded Cloud discovery and Profile selection ports.
//!
//! A native device enumerates the Workspaces its current session may sync (a
//! page of eligibility pairs, never names or routes) and selects one exact
//! Profile/Workspace pair. Selection *is* the admission: it writes the existing
//! `provisioned` device/Profile binding and invalidates the Profile's authority
//! in the same transaction. No provisioning token, receipt or worker
//! availability check exists at this boundary. Every identifier a repository
//! trusts arrives from the verified native session, never from the request
//! body.
