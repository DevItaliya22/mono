//! The preamble a delegated agent reads before its first turn, and where it
//! comes from.
//!
//! D20 makes the preamble a Markdown file under `docs/prompts/`, shipped as
//! a release asset **so that a person may edit it**. Editability is the whole
//! reason it is a file rather than a string in this crate; the copy compiled
//! in here ([`BUNDLED`]) exists so that a fresh install, and an install whose
//! edited copy is broken, still has one.
//!
//! ## The rule
//!
//! [`resolve`] looks in two places and then at the bundled copy, in this
//! order:
//!
//! 1. `<installation>/docs/prompts/delegated-agent.md` — the same layout
//!    `koru-mcp-server` reads `docs/mcp/README.md` from. The caller passes
//!    the installation's *data* directory: the executables' own on Windows,
//!    the bundle's `Resources/` on macOS (`koru_update::DATA_PREFIX`).
//! 2. **In a development build only**, the repository's own copy — the file
//!    this crate `include_str!`s, [`SOURCE_PATH`]
//!    (`crates/koru-delegate-preamble/delegated-agent.md`). A `cargo run` puts
//!    the executables in `target/debug/`, which has no `docs/` beside them, so
//!    without this an edit of the repository file changed nothing until the
//!    next build and a developer had no way to tell. `koru-mcp-server` reaches
//!    its own document the same way (`crates/koru-mcp-server/MCP.md`).
//!
//!    **The source and the installed copy are at different paths.** The
//!    source lives beside this crate so the repository builds without the
//!    `docs/` tree; the release packager copies it to [`RELATIVE_PATH`],
//!    which is what an installed Koru — and every updater already shipped —
//!    expects.
//! 3. [`BUNDLED`].
//!
//! **The file beside the exe is searched before anything else**, which is
//! the tree's standing order for anything shipped beside the executables
//! (AGENTS.md; `koru-draw`'s `asset_roots`): an edit takes effect, and a
//! package missing the file is never masked by a build machine's source
//! tree. That last clause is why step 2 is `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`
//! rather than a runtime check — `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` is an absolute path
//! baked in at compile time, so on the machine that built it a *released*
//! package would happily read the source tree and look perfect right up
//! until somebody else ran it. A release does not compile the path at all,
//! and `resolve_within(dir, None)` is that build's behaviour, asserted
//! directly.
//!
//! A copy that exists and cannot be used stops the search: the notice is
//! raised and the bundled text is used, rather than the next place along
//! quietly supplying a different file. A person who edited the copy beside
//! the executables is told their edit did not take.
//!
//! ## Objective validity only (D35)
//!
//! An edited copy is rejected for exactly five faults, every one of them a
//! fact about the file and none about its meaning: missing, empty,
//! unreadable, bad encoding, oversized. **Readable text is used as written,
//! whatever it says.** There is no semantic validator — nothing checks that
//! the tool names are still there, that a folder is still named, or that the
//! instructions are any good — because a person's edited instructions are
//! never silently discarded, and the price D35 accepts is that a person can
//! make their own agents worse and Koru will comply. The contract test in
//! `src/tests/contract.rs` pins the *bundled* text to the tool names and
//! folders P1.11 builds; it does not run against a person's copy.
//!
//! **Missing is not a fault.** A fresh install has no edited copy — the
//! package carries the file, and until somebody edits it the bundled text
//! and the shipped file are the same bytes — so a missing file resolves to
//! the bundled copy with **no notice**. The other four produce a
//! [`Notice`], because each is an edit somebody made that will not take
//! effect, and that is news.
//!
//! ## Where the run's paths come from
//!
//! The text names `.artifacts/<RunId>/` and `.koru/context/<RunId>/` with a
//! placeholder a reader understands and this crate never substitutes. **The
//! worker appends one line after the text** naming the run id and the two
//! absolute paths. Chosen over a `{{run_id}}` token because it keeps this
//! crate ignorant of the text — substitution is a parse, and a parse is the
//! beginning of a validator — and because an edited copy that lost the token
//! would otherwise lose the path silently. An appended line cannot be edited
//! away.
//!
//! ## Threads
//!
//! [`resolve`] reads the disk. The worker calls it on its own thread at run
//! start; it is never called on a thread that answers a person.
//!
//! ## Privacy
//!
//! A [`Resolved`]'s `Debug` prints the source, the byte count and the
//! notice, never the text — the text is provider payload. A [`Notice`]
//! carries a reason and, for `Oversized`, two counts; never a path. The
//! surface may show the path beside the sentence; the sentence does not
//! contain it.
