//! Dictating into a document: an ephemeral composition over one text node.
//!
//! Voice is **an ephemeral composition routed to the focused editable
//! surface**, committed as one final logical edit and one undo step
//! ([ADR-248](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-226-250.md#adr-248-voicecomposition--dictation-is-an-ephemeral-composition-and-only-the-final-transcript-is-a-transaction)).
//! This is the document half of that contract; `koru_ui::text_field` is the
//! one-line half, and [`koru_ui::dictation::DictationTarget`] is the trait
//! both answer.
//!
//! ## What is stored, and where
//!
//! [`Composition`] is a [`StableTextRange`] and a string, and it lives on
//! [`Body`] rather than on `ViewState`. That is a deliberate departure from the
//! roadmap's sketch, and the reason is the one thing this module cannot get
//! wrong: **the provisional run has to be re-spliced after every row re-read**,
//! and a row is re-read from three places (`rebuild`, `rebuild_reusing`,
//! `refresh`) that are called from dozens more. `Body` is the type that owns
//! the rows *and* is handed the `WorkspaceDoc` at every one of those points, so
//! putting the composition there makes re-splicing a hook inside the type that
//! rebuilds rather than an obligation on every caller that triggers one.
//! `ViewState` has neither the rows nor the document, so the same state kept
//! there would be re-applied by whoever remembered to. See Q-V37.
//!
//! It is still transient view state that Loro never sees — the same category as
//! `ViewState::search_flash` — and **zero Loro operations happen until commit**.
//!
//! ## The provisional text is spliced into the row
//!
//! While a composition is open, [`Paragraph::text`](crate::Paragraph::text) is
//! the **composed** string: the authored text with the replaced range swapped
//! for the transcript so far. It has to be, because a row's parley `Layout`,
//! its caret, its hit-testing, its wrapping and its selection are all indexed
//! into `row.text`, and a second string alongside it would mean a second copy
//! of all of that. `row.composition` records the splice so the two coordinate
//! spaces can be told apart — see [`Mapped`].
//! After every splice the caret is queued at the transcript's trailing edge;
//! retaining the authored caret would make streaming words grow in front of a
//! caret left behind at the start of the utterance.
//!
//! What makes that safe is the lifecycle rule, not luck: **an ordinary local
//! event commits the composition and is then re-dispatched**, so no editing
//! path ever runs while `row.text` is not the document's text. Lifecycle events
//! — window close, focus loss, sleep, shutdown — discard instead.
