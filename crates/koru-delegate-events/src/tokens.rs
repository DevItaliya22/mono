//! Every closed enum a `delegate.*` row carries, mapped to its registry
//! token by exhaustive `match`.
//!
//! The registry declares each vocabulary once (`registry.rs`'s `DELEGATE_*`
//! constants); the enums here are the run vocabulary's own where it has one
//! (`koru-delegate-core`, the session protocol) and this crate's where the
//! row's question has no enum yet (which agent, which scope kind, how the
//! tools went). A variant added to any of them is a build error here until
//! it is mapped, and `tests::tokens` proves every mapped token is inside its
//! row's vocabulary — so a token outside a vocabulary cannot be built, and
//! a vocabulary the registry widened without a builder change is caught the
//! same way.
//!
//! [`ScopeOverlap`] is the run vocabulary's own (`koru-delegate-core`): the
//! scope crate answers the overlap question, a `RunFact` carries the answer
//! across a restart, and this row spells it — one word, one definition.
