//! The phone's host for the per-Profile Cloud sync switch.
//!
//! The shared handler in `koru-account-runtime` does all the work: it reads
//! the hosted row before quoting a version, mirrors the hosted truth, and
//! signs activation challenges with the service's own device key. It needs
//! exactly two things from a host, and until now the phone supplied neither.
//!
//! Both are already here. Which Workspaces this device holds is the embedded
//! Store's catalog — the same catalog the Documents screen lists a Profile's
//! Workspaces from — and what the person already chose is a small file beside
//! the host's other durable state, next to `device.json` and `trust.db`.
//!
//! The file is deliberately not a database, and it is the same shape the
//! desktop writes (`DeviceCloudSync`, `STATE_VERSION`): ids, version numbers,
//! an incarnation and a stable failure code, nothing a person wrote. It is
//! rebuilt by re-activating if it is ever lost, so a torn write costs one
//! hosted round trip rather than content. It is still replaced atomically —
//! written to a temporary sibling, flushed, and renamed over the old file — so
//! a crash mid-write leaves the previous answer intact rather than a truncated
//! one that would read as "every Profile is off".
