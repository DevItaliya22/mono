//! The phone's half of the blob transfer engine — Plan B5.
//!
//! **One engine, composed once.** `koru-blob-sync` already runs on the
//! desktop, and `koru-store-server` composes it during the startup a phone
//! already runs (`WorkerConfig::mobile` is the embedded shape). So there is
//! nothing here that decides what a transfer does: the referenced-blob walk,
//! the two state machines, the retry table, the staging file and the
//! announcement are all the engine's. What a *platform* owns is three facts,
//! and this module is those three and nothing else:
//!
//! | Fact | Who holds it on a phone |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | the account's reach into the control plane | this process, not another one (D257) |
//! | whether the network may be used right now | Android's connectivity, through [`NetworkPolicy`] |
//! | that a picture arrived | [`Arrivals`], because there is no room registry (D242) |
//!
//! Plus the wake-ups. **A phone holds no timer of its own while backgrounded**
//! (D244), and this module does not add one: the app's existing account poll
//! is the tick, a Cloud pass runs the blob pass after it, and WorkManager's
//! recovery entry point is [`MobileBlobs::recover`] — a one-shot, not a poll.
