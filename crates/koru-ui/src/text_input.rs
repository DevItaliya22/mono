//! A one-line text box you can put anywhere and style how you like.
//!
//! [`TextField`] is the *editing* — selection, undo, paste, `Ctrl+Backspace`
//! deleting a word, and the platform key behaviour that took two bugs to get
//! right. It deliberately owns no rectangle, because the slash menu's field, a
//! rename prompt's and a table's search box are all in different places.
//!
//! What each caller then wrote for itself was the **same three lines**:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let tx = x - rect.x - text_field::PAD + field.scroll();
//! field.click(engine, tx);
//! ```
//!
//! …plus a box to draw behind it. Four copies of that arithmetic had appeared,
//! and it is exactly the kind that goes wrong quietly: get it wrong and the
//! caret lands a few pixels from where you clicked, which nobody reports as a
//! bug because it reads as imprecision.
//!
//! So this is the pairing of a field with a rect. It adds no editing behaviour
//! of its own and forwards every key to `TextField` — a box that behaved
//! differently from the slash menu's would be the thing worth avoiding.
//!
//! ## Styling
//!
//! [`InputStyle`] is deliberately small and all-optional: a fill, a border, a
//! radius, a text style. A search box is a filled chip with no border; a rename
//! field over a row is a filled box *with* one; the slash menu's sits on a panel
//! that has already drawn its own. Anything a caller needs that is not here
//! belongs drawn by the caller around this, not as a fifth field.
//!
//! ## Why it is here rather than in `koru-editor`
//!
//! The move [`TextField`] already made, for the same reason and one step later:
//! the search overlay is a box you type into over a list of results, and it has
//! to be hostable by a process that links no node model, no workspace and no
//! syntax engine. `koru-editor` re-exports it under its old path, so no call
//! site changed ([ADR-105](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-101-125.md#adr-105-ipc--mechanism-is-pushed-down-and-domain-behaviour-stays-with-its-domain)).
