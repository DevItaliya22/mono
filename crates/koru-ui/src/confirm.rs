//! A modal question with two answers, one of which destroys something --
//! or, when the question genuinely has three, with a second answer beside
//! them (see [`Confirm::with_alternative`]).
//!
//! Generic rather than trash-specific on purpose: `ErrorDialog` and
//! `CloseDialog` are already two copies of one recipe, and a third would make it
//! hard to argue against a fourth. It carries strings; the **owner** holds what
//! the question is about and matches on the answer.
//!
//! ### Enter executes the declared default
//!
//! `ErrorDialog` says Enter runs the primary — the button in the corner. Here
//! the corner button destroys twenty-four documents. A modal that appears under
//! somebody's hands and reads the next Enter as *yes, bin all of that* is
//! precisely the accident it was put up to prevent, so **this dialog's declared
//! default is Cancel** — the safe, non-destructive answer in
//! [ADR-265](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-251-275.md)'s table — and the
//! destructive one is reached by Tab or by the pointer. That is what this type
//! exists for rather than a third `ErrorDialog`, and it is unchanged.
//!
//! What ADR-265 adds is that the default is now **declared rather than
//! implied**, so a confirmation that should be acceptable by Enter can say so
//! instead of the rule being global:
//!
//! - [`Confirm::with_default`] — a *reversible* action the person explicitly
//!   invoked. Archiving and soft-deleting a workspace are the first, in
//!   `koru-workspaces-ui`.
//! - [`Confirm::declaring_no_default`] — irreversible or high-impact, where
//!   Enter must answer nothing at all until a button is deliberately focused.
//!
//! **A deliberately focused button always wins.** Tab moves the focus, and from
//! then on Enter activates what is focused rather than what was declared —
//! which is the last row of the DESIGN table and the reason the declaration
//! cannot make the visible focus ring lie.
