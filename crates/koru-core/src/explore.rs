//! What a workspace holds, as a tree: the **Explore** projection.
//!
//! This is the question the explore pane has always asked, given a name and a
//! shape that outlive the way it is answered today. Right now a workspace is one
//! `LoroDoc` and a document is a `Kind::Document` node inside it, so the answer
//! is computed from the tree. Under the store a workspace *is* a manifest and
//! the same question is one call
//! ([ADR-80](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-076-100.md#adr-80-manifest--a-workspace-is-a-manifest-document-plus-opaque-documents)).
//! [`ExploreEntry`] is field-for-field the store's `DocumentEntry`, so that swap
//! is a change of *source* rather than a redesign.
//!
//! ## Why this is derived rather than maintained
//!
//! The obvious alternative is a second structure kept in step: a manifest beside
//! the tree, updated on create, rename, move and trash. It was rejected because
//! **rename has no choke point**. A document's title is its node's text, that
//! node is row 0 of its own body, and every ordinary editing path — typing,
//! backspace, paste, cut, autoformat, the pill surgery — reaches it through
//! `set_text` / `insert_text` / `delete_text`. Roughly twenty call sites, each
//! of which would have to remember. The first one that forgot would leave a
//! title in Explore that no longer matched the document, and nothing would
//! fail — it would simply be wrong.
//!
//! Deriving cannot drift, because there is nothing to drift *from*. That is the
//! same conclusion the store reached for its own SQL mirror, where the test is
//! named `reindexing_replaces_rather_than_accumulates`: the projection is
//! replaced wholesale, never patched.
//!
//! The cost is that each call walks the tree. It is one `kind_of` per node —
//! one key off the meta map, not a `read`, which would materialise every
//! paragraph's text — and a `read` only for the documents that earn a row. That
//! is the same budget `ExploreView::rebuild` already spends.
