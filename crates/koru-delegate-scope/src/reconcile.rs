//! Rebuilding the registry after a worker restart (§7.6, §7.8).
//!
//! The registry is memory, so a restart starts empty — and an attempt that
//! was running when the worker died may still be running, or may be the
//! *prior attempt unknown* §7.6 refuses to guess about. Both keep their
//! claim: a folder is free only when its holder is known to have ended.
//! Every kept claim is resolved again against the filesystem, because an
//! alias can change while the worker is down and a stored identity would
//! be a stored guess.
