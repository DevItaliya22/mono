//! What a working scope *is* on this machine's filesystem.
//!
//! A [`WorkspaceScope`] names a folder by a project id and a relative folder
//! a person typed. Two of those can name one directory — through case, a
//! trailing separator, a `\\?\` prefix, a junction, a symlink, a short name
//! — and a string comparison would call them different. A [`ScopeIdentity`]
//! is the directory itself: the path `canonicalize` answers, broken into
//! segments folded the way the filesystem folds them, and compared
//! structurally. Its `Debug` is a hash, because a path is private.
