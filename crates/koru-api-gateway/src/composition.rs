//! What the gateway is made of: the Store worker, the events worker, the AI
//! worker, the Artifact Store, and the settings authority handed down before
//! anything is served.
//!
//! **This is the composition, unchanged.** Which constructor is called, and in
//! which order the workers open, is what a rehost is most likely to alter by
//! accident, so the whole of it lives in one function that a second host calls
//! rather than reproduces.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing and easy to lose:
//!
//! - **Optional services degrade truthfully.** A journal that will not open
//!   leaves `/v1/events` answering 503; an AI worker that will not spawn falls
//!   back to a Store-only composition whose capabilities carry `ai-disabled`;
//!   an `artifacts.db` that will not open leaves `/v1/artifacts` answering
//!   503 with no `artifacts` capability. None of them keeps the Store closed.
//! - **The account domain is deliberately absent.** The account service is
//!   the hosted Koru Cloud's (not in this repository), and the gateway has no
//!   slot for one: its account routes exist and answer 503
//!   `capability_unavailable`, and no `account` capability is published.
//!   `the_desktop_host_publishes_no_account_capability` in
//!   `apps/koru-agent/tests/gateway_host_parity.rs` is what fails if that
//!   changes.
