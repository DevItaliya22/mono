//! The run's own MCP endpoint and what it registered, through the gateway.
//!
//! Two ports over one `koru-api-client`, and between them they are what
//! makes a delegated run able to hand a result back:
//!
//! - [`GatewayAuthority`] issues the run's authority before the provider
//!   exists (`POST /v1/artifacts/authorities`), advances the generation for
//!   a second attempt so the first attempt's token dies, and revokes when
//!   the run ends. What it answers with is the launch the adapter renders:
//!   the endpoint, the bearer for **this** attempt, and the six tool names
//!   the endpoint publishes.
//! - [`GatewayRegistrations`] reads `GET /v1/artifacts/runs/{run}/versions`
//!   at each turn boundary and maps what is new to a [`ResultReference`].
//!   That answer is what decides D29 — a turn that registered nothing needs
//!   attention, a turn that registered something completes the run — and
//!   what fills the Result tab.
//!
//! **The bearer is not stored here.** It crosses once, in the issue reply,
//! goes into the [`DelegationLaunch`] and out to the session host, and this
//! module keeps no copy: a lost reply is answered by advancing the
//! generation, never by asking for the same token again (ADR-348). Nothing
//! in this file logs a token, a title or a path.
