//! The Run documents, through the gateway — never a direct SQLite open.
//!
//! §7.1 step 3 is the Store's **seeded create**: the manifest entry and
//! the document's first bytes land in one durable operation, idempotent by
//! the run id, so a retry after a lost answer finds the document it made.
//! Every commit after it goes over the Store's **sync socket** — the room
//! `document:<id>`, joined once per open handle. A commit *sends* and
//! returns; the Store's acknowledgement that the update is durable arrives
//! on the same socket and is taken in on the next pass. That split is the
//! point: the actor that commits is the one thread every request on this
//! device is answered from, and a durable acknowledgement costs what the
//! Store's disk owes at that moment, not what this call did. Where
//! durability *is* the answer — a person's request being confirmed, a fact
//! about to travel (§17.1) — [`Link::settle`] waits for it, bounded, and
//! [`Link::durable`] says whether there is anything to wait for.
//!
//! Reads are snapshots over HTTP, the way every reader opens a run.
