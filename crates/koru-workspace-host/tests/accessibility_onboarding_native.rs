//! **The first window a new person sees, driven from outside the process.**
//!
//! The pure suite in `onboarding/accessibility/tests.rs` says what the
//! first-run controller publishes. What it cannot say is the thing Plan U0.1
//! is actually for: *can a UI Automation client — the thing Narrator and
//! Accessibility Insights are — reach the account-free way into Koru, read its
//! name, and press it?* Before this plan the answer was no, and visibly so: the
//! window showed one element with nothing inside it.
//!
//! So this stands where a screen reader stands. It creates a UIA **client** in
//! the COM multi-threaded apartment, hosts a real
//! [`OnboardingView`](koru_workspace_host::onboarding::OnboardingView) in a
//! real window, reaches it through `ElementFromHandle`, finds *Continue
//! offline* by the locator an external tool would build, reads its name and
//! invokes it — and then asks whether the screen that went is gone.
//!
//! ## Why it is `#[ignore]`d
//!
//! It opens a real window on a real desktop and drives it. That is a separate
//! lane, invoked deliberately:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p koru-workspace-host --test accessibility_onboarding_native -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! ## What it proves, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! Proven: the first-run window answers a client at all; the account-free
//! control is findable by `AutomationId` without reading anything out of the
//! tree first; its `Name` is the localized *Continue offline*; `Invoke` on it
//! reaches the form and moves it to the Profile step; the Profile step's own
//! controls are then findable and the welcome screen's are **not**, which is
//! screen retirement seen from outside; a field's contents arrive on
//! `ValuePattern`; and a live region's setting arrives on
//! `UIA_LiveSettingPropertyId`.
//!
//! Not proven, and not this plan's gate: what a screen reader *says*, and
//! whether a person can complete setup on a fresh root with Narrator or NVDA.
//! That is Plan U0.2, and no number of assertions here stands in for it.
