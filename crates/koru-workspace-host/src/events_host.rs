//! Fire-and-forget event emission for the desktop app.
//!
//! One named thread and one process-global sender: an emitter anywhere in the
//! process — the shell, the container, a view — pays one `mpsc` send, O(1)
//! and off the frame loop, and this thread owns the blocking client (the
//! `koru-profile-catalog` worker shape: build lazily, keep for the thread's
//! lifetime, drop on error to force reconnect). Events are observations:
//! before [`start`], with the gateway missing, or with the `events`
//! capability absent, an emit is silently not made — the app must never
//! degrade because the bus did.
//!
//! **Why a process global**: the emitters live on both sides of the
//! shell/container boundary (`new_workspace` here, `open_search` in
//! `apps/koru`), and neither may acquire the other to say one sentence. The
//! same idiom as the theme globals. Under `cargo test` nothing calls
//! [`start`] — only `App::new` does, and tests never construct one — so every
//! `emit` is a no-op and no test can dial a live store (the no-reader
//! lesson).
