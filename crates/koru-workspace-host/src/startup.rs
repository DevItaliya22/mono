//! Two jobs, both of which have to happen before `App::new` can build anything:
//!
//! - **Deciding which profile folder.** Still resolved here for the transitional
//!   shell — `--profile <name|id|path>`, the Shift/`--pick-profile` picker, the
//!   `last-selected` marker, the most-recent profile, or a machine-local
//!   scaffold on a first start. **Content itself lives in the Koru Store**; the
//!   folder is only what settings and a few leftover call sites hang off until
//!   cutover step E deletes it. A plain launch therefore never asks where.
//! - **Saying what happened.** A recovery, a read-only document, a skipped peer
//!   log, or a failure to open at all. All four used to be an `eprintln!` into a
//!   console nobody was looking at.
//!
//! Native dialogs rather than in-app UI, because all of this happens before
//! there is an app to put UI in. `rfd` is already here for the image picker.
