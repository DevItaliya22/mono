//! **The read model's baselines, on the fixture the roadmap names** — plan

//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --release -p koru-projection --test perf -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! Every test here is `#[ignore]`d. That is the gate, and it is deliberate: the
//! roadmap corpus is 55,000 rows written into SQLite twice over, and a suite
//! that paid for it on every `cargo test --workspace` would be a tax on work
//! that has nothing to do with performance. The *structural* claims — a warm
//! query opens no document, a repeat answers identically and writes nothing, a
//! page is its limit — already run unignored beside the code, in
//! `crates/koru-projection/src/store/tests.rs` and
//! `apps/koru-store-server/tests/tasks_query.rs`. What is here is the
//! **arithmetic**, and arithmetic is what a person asks for on purpose.
//!
//! ## Ratios, not milliseconds
//!
//! `apps/koru/src/perf.rs` set the rule and `apps/koru-store-server/tests/perf.rs`
//! repeated it: **assert that something does not get worse as the corpus grows,
//! never that it takes fewer than N milliseconds.** A wall clock is a promise
//! about the machine. So every assertion below is a ratio between two sizes of
//! the same fixture, and every raw number is *printed* rather than asserted —
//! the printed table is what `docs/features/tasks/PERF_BASELINE.md` is built from.
//!
//! ## The ratios are gates now
//!
//! **Approved by the owner on 2026-09-01**, with P-Base's proposed numbers taken
//! as proposed (`PERF_BASELINE.md` §7). Every ratio this file asserts is one of
//! them, at the value the report argued for, and the looser "shape" ceilings that
//! shipped with the harness are gone — they were the line between *this machine
//! is busy* and *the answer changed shape*, which is a weaker question than the
//! one a release now has to answer. Each assertion names its case, its observed
//! range and its margin, so the next person can see what the number was bought
//! with rather than having to trust it.
//!
//! **Loosening one is a decision, not a fix.** A gate that fails is either a
//! regression or evidence the margin was wrong, and the second needs the same
//! two-run protocol the first numbers were taken under.
//!
//! ## The protocol, stated once
//!
//! Three warmups, then the median of nine runs, per roadmap §6. The warmups are
//! not politeness: the first query against a fresh connection pays SQLite's
//! statement preparation and the page cache's first read of every b-tree page it
//! will touch, and including that in a median measures the cache rather than the
//! query. [`Bench::spread`] is printed beside every median so the report can say
//! how much of a margin a threshold needs.

/// every size) and the *statement behind it* is not, because the derivation
/// predicate and the lifecycle test are correlated subqueries over `attrs`
/// evaluated per candidate row, and the candidate set is the workspace. So a
/// hundred times the corpus costs more than a hundred times the page, not less.

/// named — a covering index over `attrs` — is sized in
/// `docs/features/tasks/PERF_BASELINE.md` rather than built here.
///
/// Four sizes, so the report can say what the curve *is* rather than quoting one
/// ratio: the exponent is fitted across the whole range and printed.
///
/// **The assertion is the shape, not the number**, and since 2026-09-01 it is
/// the *approved* shape: gate (a.1), exponent below 1.45. It was measured at
/// 1.32–1.34 when the correlated `attrs` probes each ended in a random table row
/// read, and at **0.75–0.85** once `attrs_probe` covered them — genuinely
/// sub-linear, which is what the roadmap had hoped for and what the pre-index
/// baseline had to report it was not. The ceiling stayed at the number approved
/// against the *worse* measurement rather than being tightened to the better one:
/// 1.45 is what an added join or a lost index has to clear, and the whole margin
/// between 0.85 and 1.45 is now the room the index bought.

// -------------------------------------------- (e) R-1b's three statements

/// **R-1b's cost note, re-measured under one protocol.**
///
/// Roadmap §6 case (e). The three statements a Tasks surface asks on open — the
/// rail's five bucket counts, the lists' counts, and one page of rows — measured
/// on the same corpus, in the same process, with the same warmups and the same
/// median, so the report carries one table rather than three numbers from three
/// occasions.
///
/// The interesting shape is the *order*: the counts walk the corpus and the page
/// does not, so the counts are where a covering index over `attrs` pays most and
/// the page is where it shows least.
///
/// **The index exists now** (`attrs_probe`, schema 8), and this test is what
/// priced it: it fell out at 4–8× rather than the 1.6–2× the report had sized,
/// because the plan was worse than the sizing assumed — two of the rail's probes
/// were reaching `attrs_value (role=?, value=?)` and scanning *every* completed
/// row in the corpus per candidate, not merely paying a row read each. The
/// decomposition at the bottom of this test is now the evidence that it worked:
/// turning both `attrs` predicates off saves nothing measurable, where before it
/// saved three quarters of the page.
///
/// So the last line prices the *other* sort key. What is left of a page is the
/// `ORDER BY`, and `TaskSort::Due` folds three temporal types onto one number
/// with a `strftime` per dated row — which no index over `attrs` reaches.
/// `TaskSort::Modified` is `d.modified_at` and asks for none of it, so the pair
/// says how much of what remains is the fold. It is a measurement rather than a
/// proposal: nothing here suggests changing a default sort.
