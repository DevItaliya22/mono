//! What a document looks like to everything that is not the editor.
//!
//! ## Strings and primitives, on purpose
//!
//! Nothing here names a type from `koru-core`. A kind is the token
//! `Kind::as_str()` already stores in Loro, a heading is a number, an attribute
//! value is a tagged string. That is not laziness about types — it is the
//! boundary: **a consumer of the projection links no node model at all.** The
//! search index, a retrieval pipeline and a kanban view each get everything they
//! need from this crate and `rusqlite`, and none of them acquires an opinion
//! about what a `Kind::ListBlock` is.
//!
//! The tokens are the same ones the document stores, so they are stable for the
//! same reason the storage keys are: changing one orphans what is written with
//! it.
//!
//! ## What is here, and the test that decided it
//!
//! **Can a consumer recover this without reopening the document?** Carry what
//! fails that test; resolve everything else by joining.
//!
//! - Structure, kind and the block properties a view branches on — nothing else
//!   has them.
//! - Plain text, which is the matchable truth.
//! - **Runs**, so emphasis, links and pill anchors survive. A rendering consumer
//!   — an export, a preview, a context window — would otherwise have to open the
//!   `LoroDoc` itself, which is the thing this exists to prevent.
//! - **Typed attributes.** A date stays a date. Flattening them into text is
//!   what makes a calendar impossible to build on this.
//!
//! What is deliberately absent from a **node**: the document's title path.
//! Denormalizing it there would make a rename rewrite every descendant —
//! turning a one-document edit into an N-document write, which is the one cost
//! this layer must never have. It is carried instead as [`ListedDocument`], one
//! row per document, where a rename is one row.
//!
//! Search vocabulary — fragments, breadcrumbs, normalized terms — is absent.
//! That is an index's business, and putting it here would make every other
//! consumer inherit search's shape.
