//! The frames the local transport speaks to the delegate worker.

//! One connection per call: the client writes one [`Request`], the worker
//! answers one [`Response`], and the connection closes — except a stream,
//! where the worker keeps writing [`Response::Item`] frames until
//! [`Response::End`]. `koru_ipc::frame` carries them; [`WIRE_VERSION`] is
//! stamped on every frame and a peer that reads another version closes.
//!
//! The worker's own verbs — the readiness hello the supervisor probes and
//! the authenticated stop — ride the same frames so the endpoint has one
//! reader.
