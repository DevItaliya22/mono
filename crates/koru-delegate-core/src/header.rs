//! The sync side: what a run means on every device (D14).
//!
//! A [`RunHeader`] is what the Run document carries — objective, agent,
//! scope, context as given, status, executing device, artifact references,
//! the economics summary and the rating — and a [`DelegatedRun`] is the
//! header with its timeline. Every field here syncs (D3) and every device
//! reads it; only the executing device writes it (D15).
//!
//! **Nothing here says how the attempt ran.** The provider session key, the
//! process facts and the pending publications are [`crate::AttemptState`]'s,
//! and there is deliberately no `From` in either direction: the two types
//! share a [`RunId`] and nothing else, so a field cannot land on the wrong
//! side by conversion.
//!
//! **Serde tolerates what it does not know.** No type on this side uses
//! `deny_unknown_fields`, and the fields a later build added carry
//! `#[serde(default)]`: a header written by a newer build must open on an
//! older one. Preserving those unknown fields across a *save* is not this
//! struct's job — the Run document is a Loro map and P1.4's representation
//! keeps keys it does not read — but refusing to read them would be.
