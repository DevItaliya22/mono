//! A run's history, one lean step at a time (D45).
//!
//! An entry carries an id, a step kind, references to what it touched, a
//! time and bounded counts — **never a copy of anything**. This is the event
//! bus's own rule applied to the run's history, and it is what makes D32
//! (keep everything, everywhere, forever) affordable and safe at once: a
//! step records *that* a document was read, not what it said, so retaining
//! it costs tens of bytes and leaks nothing.
//!
//! The rule is enforced by the compiler. Every type an entry may contain
//! implements [`ContentFree`], a sealed trait `String` never implements, and
//! `entry_is_content_free` below destructures every field and every variant
//! payload so that adding a text field anywhere in an entry fails to build.
