//! The shared vocabulary of delegated runs and schedule outcomes.
//!
//! Koru can run a coding agent in a tab; delegation is handing it work and
//! coming back to a result you can read, trust and use again. This crate is
//! the *nouns* of that feature and the one *verb* that moves a run between
//! states. It starts nothing, stores nothing, transports nothing and draws
//! nothing — the orchestrator, `runs.db`, the Run document, the `delegate.*`
//! events and every surface depend on it, and it depends on none of them.
//!
//! Three rules shape everything here:
//!
//! - **The sync/execution split is a type boundary.** What a run *means* on
//!   every device is a [`RunHeader`] (D14); how far *this machine* got is an
//!   [`AttemptState`] (D3). They share a [`RunId`] and nothing else, and no
//!   `From` exists between them, so a field cannot land on the wrong side.
//! - **The status moves through one closed function.** [`transition`] is the
//!   only way from one [`RunStatus`] to another; every (state, event) pair it
//!   refuses is asserted illegal by a test. `AwaitingReview` and
//!   `WaitingForParticipant` exist so a later milestone unlocks a transition
//!   rather than rewriting a terminal state, and nothing reaches them yet.
//! - **Privacy is structural.** A [`TimelineEntry`] cannot carry text at all
//!   ([`ContentFree`] is sealed and `String` never implements it); the text a
//!   person writes — the objective, a rating note, an artifact title, a folder
//!   — lives in newtypes whose `Debug` redacts, so no derived `Debug` above
//!   them can leak it.
//!
//! Schedule templates and recurrence remain in `koru-delegate-schedule`; only
//! the content-free pause, context-stage and firing-outcome enums live here so
//! Schedule documents and `delegate.schedule.*` events cannot drift apart.
