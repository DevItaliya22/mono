//! A run's status, and the one closed function that moves it.
//!
//! §7.5 is the specification: which provider event means what to the run,
//! who may complete it, and what fences completion. Everything a run can be
//! is a [`RunStatus`]; everything that can happen to one is a [`RunEvent`];
//! [`transition`] is the only way from one to the other, and it refuses every
//! pair it does not explicitly allow. A test enumerates the pairs.
//!
//! Two shapes are deliberate:
//!
//! - **Markers, not more statuses.** An approval, a wait for input, a
//!   detected child session or a turn that ended with nothing registered
//!   (D29) is a run that is still `Running` and needs a look — an
//!   [`Attention`] on the state, never a sibling of it. Control handover
//!   (§7.4) is a second dimension, [`ControlState`], because it fences what
//!   the orchestrator may do and what a completion may mean.
//! - **Two states nothing reaches.** `AwaitingReview` and
//!   `WaitingForParticipant` are minted now, with no transition into or out
//!   of them, so M5 unlocks a transition instead of rewriting a terminal
//!   state.
//!
//! The attempt-generation fence (an event from an older attempt may not
//! touch status) is applied *before* this function is called — see
//! [`crate::AttemptGeneration::admits`]. This function reasons about one
//! attempt at a time.
