//! Running a role of our own executable as a supervised child.
//!
//! **This crate can name no role.** It owns the mechanism a self-hosted
//! worker needs — the early-`main` dispatch that turns `koru-agent.exe
//! --worker <role>` into that role's entry point, the `current_exe()` spawn,
//! the one-line bootstrap over an inherited stdin pipe that doubles as the
//! parent-death signal *and the watcher that notices it*, the per-child
//! Windows Job Object so a worker's whole
//! process tree dies with it, readiness and health probing, a bounded
//! restart budget with backoff, and the hold/resume window an update needs —
//! and nothing about what any particular worker does. Role knowledge
//! (endpoints, authorities, bootstrap contents) stays with the role, passed
//! in as closures and an opaque payload.
//!
//! Two sides, two entry points:
//!
//! - The **worker side** calls [`dispatch`] as the first thing in `main`.
//!   When `--worker <role>` is present the matching role's entry runs and
//!   never returns; an unknown role or malformed worker arguments are
//!   refused loudly (the token named, the roles listed, exit 2) before any
//!   parent machinery could start. With no `--worker` argument, `dispatch`
//!   returns and `main` continues as the parent.
//! - The **parent side** calls [`supervisor::start`] with a
//!   [`supervisor::WorkerSpec`], getting back a [`supervisor::WorkerHandle`]
//!   whose current-child accessor is generation-fenced: an operation minted
//!   against child A is refused once child B has taken over, never routed
//!   to B through their shared endpoint.
//!
//! The state machine itself is pure and lives in [`machine`], where it is
//! unit-tested without processes; the supervisor's control thread is the
//! only place timers, pipes and process handles meet it.
