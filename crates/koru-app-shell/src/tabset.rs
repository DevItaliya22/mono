//! The open tabs, and which of them is showing.
//!
//! ## Why this is a type and not two fields
//!
//! `active` is an index into `tabs`, so every operation that removes or reorders
//! a tab has to keep it valid. That was five separate clamps, written five
//! times — in `close`, `move_tab`, `restore`, `drop_dead_tabs` and `select` —
//! and each one had to remember the same two rules: the index stays in range,
//! and the list is never empty. Here the fields are private, so the only code
//! that can break the invariant is the code that states it.
//!
//! ## The list is never empty, and the floor mints through a host factory
//!
//! There used to be a **permanent** tab — the outline — that `close` refused,
//! because closing it would have left the `outline/` realm with no way back.
//! What replaced it is weaker and simpler: closing the last tab leaves a fresh
//! tab rather than nothing. Every caller still gets "there is always an active
//! tab", and no tab is special.
//!
//! **What that fresh tab *is* is the host's**, so it arrives as a factory
//! closure rather than a constant ([ADR-262](../../../docs/decisions/README.md)):
//! a stored prototype would be payload the shell persists, which the minimal
//! contract forbids. A set built with [`TabSet::empty`] has no factory and is
//! allowed to be empty — that is the pinned group, which legitimately has no
//! tabs at all.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not own
//!
//! **Geometry.** `select` moves the index; it does not lay the tab out, because
//! what size a tab should be is a question about the window, which this knows
//! nothing about. The container calls its own resize afterwards. Keeping that
//! out is what lets every method here be tested without a viewport.
//!
//! **Meaning.** It is generic over its element and never asks one a question:
//! finding "the tab over this document" is [`position`](TabSet::position) with a
//! predicate the host wrote, because a document is a thing this crate may not
//! name.

/// How a set that must never be empty gets its replacement tab.
///
/// A boxed closure rather than a stored value, so the floor is minted when it is
/// needed and the set holds no tab-shaped payload of its own.
