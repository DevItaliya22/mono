//! One floating panel, anchored under the chip that opened it.
//!
//! **The shell owns open, dismiss, anchor and clamp; the rows are the host's.**
//! That split is the whole of DESIGN's "The banner" §8 as a type: this holds
//! *which slot is open* and *where the panel landed*, and asks the host to draw
//! into the rect it worked out. A shell that owned the rows would be a shell
//! that knew what a profile is.
//!
//! Every rule here comes from `koru_ui::popover::PopoverShell::anchored`, which
//! already flips above when below would overflow and clamps into the viewport
//! with `EDGE = 8` and its own `GAP = 6`. Nothing is reimplemented; what is added
//! are the two decisions that module cannot make — **the viewport is the content
//! rect, not the window**, so a popover never lands over the caption it came
//! from, and **the clearance is [`GAP`], Koru's own**, measured from the chip a
//! person can see rather than from the slot behind it.
