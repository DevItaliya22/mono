//! `/v1/runs/{run}/mcp` — the stable per-run MCP endpoint a delegated
//! provider is handed (ROADMAP §7.3, D6, D28).
//!
//! **Not the desktop bridge.** `koru-mcp` carries every local workspace and
//! twenty-odd document tools; this endpoint carries six artifact tools and
//! nothing that edits a document, and the only thing it knows about its
//! caller is the run authority record the bearer resolves to — never a run
//! id, an actor or a workspace the call names. Provenance derives from
//! that record; the grant set is read from it and frozen for the attempt;
//! a revocation or a fresh attempt is a row in `artifacts.db` that the
//! next call reads, so a delegate worker that crashed leaves a surviving
//! provider still publishing, and a restarted gateway answers the same
//! token.
//!
//! **The transport is Streamable HTTP, stateless, JSON responses.** The
//! shape Codex's `mcp_servers.<name>.url` expects (`docs/features/terminal/providers/codex.md`),
//! and the shape the official SDK's own tower server offers under its
//! `json_response` setting: a JSON-RPC request is one `POST`, answered with
//! `application/json`; a notification is `202 Accepted`; there is no
//! `Mcp-Session-Id`, because there is no session — the bearer is the whole
//! of the caller's identity, resolved on every call — and `GET` answers
//! `405`, because the server never speaks first. The SDK's server-side HTTP
//! feature would have added `sse-stream` to the tree, which standing
//! requirement 12 refuses; what is reused instead is the SDK's *model* —
//! its JSON-RPC envelopes, its `Tool` definitions with schemas, its
//! `CallToolResult` with `structuredContent` — so a client built on the SDK
//! (the protocol test here uses one) sees exactly what it expects.
//!
//! The pieces: [`transport`] parses and answers JSON-RPC; [`tools`] is the
//! six definitions and their dispatch; [`staging`] is the register path
//! rule over `<run-workspace>/.artifacts/<RunId>/`; [`blobs`] is the bytes'
//! round trip through the Store.
