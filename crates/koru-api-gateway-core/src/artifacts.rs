//! `/v1/artifacts` — the Artifact Store's public routes (D1, D13).
//!
//! The same shape as the AI routes: a catalogued table, one handler per
//! row, scope checked before dispatch, the domain answered through its typed
//! port ([`koru_artifact_api::ArtifactServerPort`]) from `spawn_blocking`.
//! The store is composed by the host and handed to
//! [`GatewayState::set_artifact_service`]; when it is absent — `artifacts.db`
//! would not open — every route answers 503 `artifacts_unavailable` and the
//! `artifacts` capability is not published, the way `/v1/events` behaves
//! without a journal.
//!
//! **Bytes never pass through these routes.** A registration names a
//! [`BlobHash`] already in the family's workspace, uploaded through the
//! Store's `PUT /v1/workspaces/{id}/blobs` (its own 2 GiB limit, streamed);
//! the metadata body here is capped at
//! [`koru_artifact_wire::METADATA_BODY_LIMIT`], and the gateway asks the
//! Store whether the hash is there before the version exists. Reading a
//! version's content forwards to the Store's blob route and returns its
//! response as it is — the artifact route buffers nothing.
//!
//! **A version is immutable at this layer too.** `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE`
//! on a version are mounted and answer 409 `artifact_version_immutable`,
//! the code the database's trigger raises, so a client that tries to rewrite
//! one reads the rule rather than a 405.
//!
//! **The run authority lives here too** (§7.3): `/v1/artifacts/authorities`
//! is where the orchestrator issues a run's endpoint token, advances its
//! generation and revokes it, and `/v1/artifacts/runs/{run}/versions` is
//! what a run has registered — the hook the orchestrator reads at a turn
//! boundary (D29). The endpoint the token opens is `run_mcp`'s.
