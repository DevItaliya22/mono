//! Where a channel keeps its data.
//!
//! **A release channel is a hard boundary.** Stable, beta, nightly and a local
//! build never share a database, because they do not share a schema: a nightly
//! that has moved `workspace.db` forward would be opened by stable, refused,
//! and — if the refusal ever leaked — half-written. Separate directories make
//! that impossible rather than merely unlikely.
//!
//! The same logical workspace may exist in several of them at once. Those are
//! **replicas**: same immutable id, separate physical state, and one day they
//! will converge through ordinary sync. They must never open each other's
//! files.
//!
//! ## Five segments from a four-variant enum
//!
//! [`ReleaseChannel`] answers "what build is this", and returns `Internal` for
//! anything built locally by cargo. That is one segment too few: a debug build
//! and a `--release` build of the same tree are different binaries with
//! different behaviour, and sharing a store between them is exactly the
//! confusion this module removes. So `Internal` splits on
//! `cfg!(debug_assertions)`.
//!
//! This also retires the ad-hoc `cfg!(debug_assertions)` in
//! `crates/koru-workspace-host/src/startup.rs`, which decided the same question a
//! different way for `profiles.conf`.
