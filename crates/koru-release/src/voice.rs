//! **`koru-release voice-models` — download the speech models, repackage them,
//! and publish them to Koru's own origin.**
//!
//! Four subcommands, and the split between them is which of the three
//! expensive, irreversible things each one is allowed to do:
//!
//! | | reads the origin | downloads gigabytes | **writes to production** |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `plan` | yes, publicly | no | no |
//! | `pin` | no | yes | no |
//! | `fetch` | no | yes | no |
//! | `publish` | yes, publicly | only what is missing | **only with `--upload`** |
//!
//! **The default is a dry run**, in the same shape and for the same reason as
//! `release-index --dry-run`: everything the plan is built from is public, so
//! rehearsing a publish needs no Cloudflare token and is something anybody in
//! the tree can do. `updates.koru.do` is live, and a tool that could write to
//! it by being run without arguments is a tool that eventually does.
//!
//! ## What a re-run costs
//!
//! Nothing it does not have to. Three things make that true, and each is doing
//! separate work:
//!
//! - **The archive's key holds its digest**, so *present at the right length*
//!   is proof, and the check is a `HEAD` rather than a 475 MB `GET`.
//! - **The repacked digest is pinned in the table**, so every key can be
//!   computed with nothing downloaded at all. A publish where everything is
//!   already up costs four `HEAD`s and two `GET`s of a few kilobytes.
//! - **The repack is deterministic**, which is what makes the line above
//!   trustworthy rather than optimistic.
//!
//! The two JSON documents are compared byte for byte and skipped when
//! identical, so a re-publish after adding one model rewrites one descriptor
//! and the catalog and nothing else.
//!
//! ## What this tool deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not sign anything, and it does not mint a key. `MODEL_SIGNING_KEYS`
//! is empty because holding a private half is an operations decision the owner
//! has deferred until before public release; the descriptor carries every field
//! that key would one day sign, and `catalog::UNSIGNED` is what sits in the
//! signature field until then. A publisher that generated its own keypair to
//! make the field look right would be manufacturing exactly the trust ADR-250
//! exists to refuse.
