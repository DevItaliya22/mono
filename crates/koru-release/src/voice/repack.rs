//! **`.tar.bz2` in, `.zip` out, with the licence inside it.**
//!
//! Every speech model this product ships is published upstream as a
//! `.tar.bz2`, and `koru-voice-models` reads exactly one archive format:
//! `koru_update::extract_zip`, the hardened one, with `ArchiveLimits`,
//! traversal defences and a zip-bomb bound. Q-V50 settled which side gives way
//! and the reasoning is worth restating, because the tempting alternative looks
//! cheaper right up until it is deployed:
//!
//! - A signed `format` field on the descriptor costs a schema bump and a
//!   re-sign of every catalog entry, and buys the ability to serve somebody
//!   else's archive layout — which we do not do. ADR-250 already says models
//!   come from our own infrastructure under our own signature, so the
//!   publishing step is ours and already rewrites the bytes.
//! - **An extractor is a security boundary, and one is cheaper to defend than
//!   two.** A tar reader and a bzip2 decoder in `koru-voice-models` would put
//!   those defences in the tree twice, and the second copy is the one nobody
//!   reviews. Here they sit in a tool run by hand a few times a year, on a
//!   machine that already holds the release token.
//!
//! The cost is honest and is paid here: our origin holds a second copy of
//! ~2 GB of weights, and the provenance chain gains one link — *upstream
//! `.tar.bz2` → our zip → our descriptor*. That link is recorded where the
//! licence is recorded, in `NOTICE.txt`, because a repackaged CC-BY-4.0
//! artifact still carries its attribution and a repackaged OpenMDW-1.1 one
//! still has to carry the agreement.
//!
//! ## Two things about the zip that are not cosmetic
//!
//! **The tar's top-level directory is stripped.** `DiskModelStore` extracts
//! into `<id>/<version>/<digest>/` and the engine adapter resolves
//! `encoder.int8.onnx` directly beneath the directory it is handed. A zip that
//! kept the wrapper installs a model one level too deep, and the only symptom
//! is `has neither encoder.int8.onnx nor encoder.onnx` from a directory that
//! visibly contains one.
//!
//! **The zip is deterministic.** Fixed entry timestamps, fixed permissions, and
//! the tar's own order — so the same pinned upstream bytes always produce the
//! same digest. The digest *is* the published key, so a zip that varied
//! between runs would make every re-run a fresh upload of bytes already there,
//! and `ModelArtifact::repacked_sha256` would be a lie rather than a shortcut.
