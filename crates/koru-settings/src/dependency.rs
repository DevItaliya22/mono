//! The fence around the authority's dependencies.
//!
//! This crate is linked into the API gateway process. A UI crate reaching in
//! here would put parley and vello behind an HTTP handler; an async runtime
//! would put a second one beside the gateway's own. Neither would fail to
//! compile — they would just quietly make the authority expensive to host, and
//! the mistake would be found by somebody wondering why the gateway binary
//! grew. So it is a test.
//!
//! The fence around who may *open* a settings file is here too, for the same
//! reason: three parsers of `preferences.conf` is what ADR-266 exists to
//! remove, and "there is only one now" is a sentence that decays into a
//! comment unless something fails when a fourth appears.

/// **`preferences.conf` has exactly one reader and one writer.**
///
/// It had three parsers — this crate's predecessors in `koru-workspace-host`,
/// `koru-window` and `koru-dictation` — plus an undocumented fourth in the
/// Agent's tray that read the file line by line and tolerated neither a
/// byte-order mark nor a space before the `=`. They disagreed about what a
/// value meant, which is the defect ADR-266 exists to remove.
///
/// **A file nobody can locate is a file nobody can parse**, so what this pins
/// is the *locator*. Outside this crate there is exactly one —
/// `koru_window::user_preferences_path` — and this lists every file allowed to
/// name it, with what each one is for. Its own resolver, `SettingsPaths`, never
/// leaves this crate: it is private to the authority by construction, since a
/// caller would have to link `koru-settings` and then still ask the Gateway.
///
/// **Adding a name here is a decision**, and having to make it deliberately is
/// the whole point of the test. Prose about the move is deliberately not
/// counted: the mistake being guarded against is opening the file, not
/// mentioning it.
