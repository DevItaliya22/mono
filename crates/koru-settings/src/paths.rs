//! Where the settings files are — resolved once, injected everywhere.
//!
//! **`preferences.conf` could not be rooted before this crate existed**, and
//! that is survey note 3. `koru_window::user_preferences_path` takes no
//! arguments and reads `APPDATA`/`HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directly, so both
//! the reader and the writer in `koru-workspace-host` resolved a real
//! per-developer path with no override and no setter. The consequence is
//! written down in that file: a test that exercised saving would write into
//! `%APPDATA%`, which is the developer's own settings, so the tests assert on
//! a pure comparison function instead and the persistence itself was never
//! covered.
//!
//! Here every path arrives through [`SettingsPaths`]. Production calls
//! [`SettingsPaths::discover`] once at the Gateway boundary; every test calls
//! [`SettingsPaths::under_root`] with a temp directory. Nothing else resolves
//! a location, so no test can reach a real preferences or local-app-data path
//! even by accident.
