//! What every handler shares.
//!
//! One [`Store`] behind one mutex. That is a real serialisation point, and it
//! is the right shape for the MVP rather than an oversight:
//!
//! - The management routes are not a hot path — a workspace is listed when
//!   somebody opens a switcher, not per keystroke.
//! - The editing path is `apply_update` → `flush`, and `flush` is already
//!   serialised by SQLite's write lock. A finer-grained scheme would contend on
//!   the same disk.
//!
//! What it does foreclose is two workspaces committing in parallel, which will
//! matter with enough of them open at once. The shape that fixes it is a lock
//! per workspace rather than one for the store, and it is recorded in TECHDEBT
//! rather than guessed at now — the number to optimise against is the one in
//! the stage 10 measurements, and it does not exist yet.
