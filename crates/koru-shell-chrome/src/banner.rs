//! The banner slots: where the account profile, the workspace, and Settings
//! live in the caption row.
//!
//! ```text
//! [≡] [◯ profile][ Workspace ⌄ ]  [ tab ][ tab ✕ ][ + ]      [⚙]  ⋮  ─  □  ✕
//!       ^              ^                                      ^
//!       profile_slot   workspace_slot                         settings_slot
//! ```
//!
//! Chrome owns only the slots. Which profile is showing, what a workspace is,
//! and what opening Settings means are all the host's business
//! ([ADR-262](../../../docs/decisions/README.md)): a press here answers
//! [`Hit::Profile`], never a profile id. The popovers a slot opens are the
//! shell's, and their *rows* are the host's — this file is the arithmetic both
//! share.
//!
//! Every rect is derived from the caption alone, in the caption module's idiom:
//! a slot that is not offered is a **zero-width rect** rather than an absence,
//! so the neighbouring arithmetic reclaims the space with no second code path,
//! and hit-testing excludes it explicitly because `Rect::contains` is inclusive
//! on every edge.
//!
//! Since SP-12 the Settings slot is the outermost member of the caption's
//! trailing chain rather than an alias of the context toggle's rect: a window
//! may now offer both, and the toggle takes the square to Settings' left.
//!
//! ## The identity has a second home
//!
//! Owner, 2026-09-02: a window may put the profile and workspace selectors in
//! the **pane header band** instead — the `CAPTION_H` strip at the top of the
//! explore column, which is where Koru itself draws them.
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────

//!
//! That is `pane_profile_slot` / `pane_workspace_slot`, and they are the same
//! arithmetic ([`identity_slots`]) laid out from the band's own left edge rather
//! than after the sidebar toggle. Settings does not move: it is caption
//! furniture. The ladder does not change either — only its budget, which is
//! [`pane_fits`] rather than [`fits`].
//!
//! ## Who gives way
//!
//! The tab lane is what the window is for, so the give-way order inside the
//! caption is the mirror of [`regions::solve`](crate::regions::solve)'s outside
//! it: the window controls, the sidebar toggle and then [`LANE_RESERVE`] — one
//! minimum tab, its gap and the `+` — are reserved *before* the banner takes
//! anything. [`fits`] answers whether a given set of slots leaves that much, and
//! the collapse ladder that walks a banner down until it does is the container's
//! (`DESIGN.md`, "The banner" §2): it is evaluated against the settled caption,
//! once per toggle, never per animation frame.
