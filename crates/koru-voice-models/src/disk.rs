//! **The filesystem [`ModelStore`]: install, lease, load, prune, remove.**
//!
//! Plan 1.1 wrote the three interfaces; this is the implementation behind them,
//! and every decision in it comes from one fact — **the model cache is
//! channel-independent, so it has more than one writer**. A released build and
//! a dev build install, load, prune and remove into the same directory, and
//! neither can see the other's memory. Four mechanisms follow, and none of them
//! is optional:
//!
//! **Atomic publish.** A model is assembled in `.staging/` and reaches its
//! final name by one `rename`. There is no moment at which a concurrent reader
//! can meet a directory that is half extracted, because a directory either has
//! its final name or does not exist. This is also why the signed descriptor is
//! written *into staging* rather than after the rename: the file that says
//! *this is installed* arrives in the same instant as the bytes it describes.
//!
//! **A per-digest install lock.** Two workers reaching for the same 650 MB
//! produce one download and one wait. It is taken blocking, so the second one
//! finds the model installed the moment it wakes rather than being told to come
//! back.
//!
//! **A lease per live holder.** `prune` and `remove` ask the filesystem who is
//! using a model, not their own process. A lease is taken under the *shared*
//! side of the same install lock a delete takes exclusively, which is what
//! closes the window between *it is installed* and *nothing may delete it*.
//!
//! **Crash recovery with no clock.** A lease whose holder died unlocks, and is
//! reclaimed; a staging directory whose `.busy` unlocks is debris, and is
//! swept. Neither asks what time it is, because a heartbeat is wrong on a
//! machine whose clock moved and a stored pid is wrong on one that reused a pid.
//!
//! ## Offline is the ordinary state
//!
//! `.koru-model.json` sits inside every published model directory and carries
//! the **signed** descriptor and the signature that vouched for it. Loading a
//! model therefore needs no catalog, no `HEAD` and no network: `installed()`
//! and `find()` read that file and nothing else. It is also why a key that has
//! since been retired does not break anything already here — verification
//! happened once, at install, against the key that was pinned then, and this
//! file is the record of it (ADR-250).
//!
//! **It is deliberately not re-verified on every read.** Re-verifying would
//! make a rotation retroactively uninstall models, which is precisely what the
//! ADR says must not happen. What *is* checked on every read is cheaper and
//! catches the thing a signature cannot: that the descriptor's own
//! `id`/`version`/`digest` are the three directory names it was found under. A
//! metadata file moved into another model's directory names a different model
//! and is refused.
//!
//! ## The one thing this cannot know
//!
//! **A model archive is a zip.** The descriptor has no `format` field, and
//! adding one is a schema bump and a re-sign of every catalog entry
//! (ADR-250) — not a decision Plan 1.2 may take on its own. So the archive is
//! extracted with `koru_update::extract_zip` under [`ArchiveLimits`], which is
//! the hardened extractor the roadmap names, and anything that is not a zip is
//! [`InstallFailed`](ModelErrorCode::InstallFailed) with a message that says
//! so. Recorded as `docs/features/voice/archive/QUESTIONS.md` Q-V27.
