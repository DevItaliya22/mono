//! **Stable codes for everything the model store can refuse, and the one
//! translation into the session's vocabulary.**
//!
//! `{ code, message }` again — the convention
//! [PRINCIPLES](../../../guide/contributing/PRINCIPLES.md) sets for every API in this
//! product, and the shape [`koru_voice::VoiceError`] already uses. `code` is
//! branched on and logged; `message` is untranslated developer text nobody may
//! show a person.
//!
//! ## Why this is a second enum rather than more arms on [`koru_voice::ErrorCode`]
//!
//! That enum is the *session* vocabulary: fourteen codes a client matches
//! exhaustively while a dictation is running, and its own doc comment says so.
//! Installing a model is not a dictation. It happens from a tray menu, from a
//! settings page and from a command line, minutes or days before anyone speaks,
//! and it fails in ways a session has no words for — a signature from a key
//! nobody pinned, a catalog reusing an id, a download somebody cancelled.
//! Folding those into `ErrorCode` would make `ModelLoadFailed` mean nine
//! different things and would grow the list every client must match on for
//! reasons no client cares about.
//!
//! So there are two closed enums and **one** total mapping between them:
//! [`ModelErrorCode::session_code`]. A worker that fails to get a model answers
//! its session with that, and keeps the specific code for its log and its
//! `status` table. The mapping is a `match` with no wildcard, so a new code
//! here is a compile error there rather than a silent `ModelLoadFailed`.
