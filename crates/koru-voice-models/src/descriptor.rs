//! **What is signed: every field of a model that changes behaviour, consent or
//! licence compliance, in a byte sequence two implementations can produce.**
//!
//! The tempting envelope is the digest, and it is too small. A catalog entry
//! carries fields that do real harm without a single byte of the archive
//! changing: an unsigned `engine` routes verified bytes into the wrong native
//! parser, an unsigned `working_set_bytes` understates what a phone needs and
//! defeats Milestone 4's device gate, an unsigned `languages` changes what the
//! product claims to support, and an unsigned `attribution` changes what a
//! licence notice says about somebody else's work.
//! [ADR-250](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-226-250.md) argues each of those; this
//! module is the shape it settled on.
//!
//! ## Why the canonical form is written by hand
//!
//! *Whatever this `serde_json` emitted* is a specification only for programs
//! that link this `serde_json`. The signing tool will one day not be this
//! program — a release pipeline, a third party signing their own weights — and
//! at that point the signed bytes have to be something a person can implement
//! from a paragraph. So [`ModelDescriptor::canonical_bytes`] is a fixed-order,
//! LF-terminated, tab-separated line format, and its first line names the
//! schema version so a reader knows before parsing whether it understands what
//! follows.
//!
//! ```text
//! koru-model-descriptor/1
//! id\tparakeet-tdt-v3
//! version\t1.2.0
//! engine\tsherpa
//! tier\tcompact
//! languages\ten,es,pt-BR,de,fr,ar,zh-Hans,ja
//! size\t648291840
//! digest\t9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08
//! working_set_bytes\t1073741824
//! licence\tApache-2.0
//! attribution\tk2-fsa, Apache-2.0
//! ```
//!
//! Only `attribution` is free text, so only `attribution` is escaped —
//! backslash, newline, carriage return and tab. Every other field's own charset
//! rule already excludes the separators, which is why those rules are enforced
//! at construction and not at signing time: a value that cannot hold a tab
//! cannot smuggle a field boundary into the envelope.
//!
//! ## The one rule about a version this build does not know
//!
//! It is refused, and it is refused **before** any signature is checked.
//! Canonicalising a shape we do not understand produces bytes the signer never
//! signed, so the failure would arrive as
//! [`SignatureInvalid`](crate::ModelErrorCode::SignatureInvalid) — an attack
//! report for what is only an old build.
