//! **Install, lease, load — the three interfaces Plans 1.2 and 1.3 are written
//! against, normative in Rust rather than described in prose.**
//!
//! This module is the seam that lets the model store and the worker be built in
//! parallel. Rev 1 of the roadmap called them parallel while the worker depended
//! on an API the store had not specified; a seam written as prose is a seam two
//! agents interpret differently, so it is written here as types.
//!
//! Plan 1.1 defined these and implemented none of them; Plan 1.2 wrote
//! [`crate::DiskModelStore`] behind them — paths, resumable downloads, a
//! per-digest cross-process install lock, atomic publish, and lease
//! reclamation after a crash — without changing a signature here. Plan 1.3's
//! worker consumes exactly what is in this file and nothing more.
//!
//! ## The three, and why they are three
//!
//! **Install** puts verified bytes on the disk and is slow, cancellable and
//! progress-reporting. **Lease** says *somebody is using this*, and exists only
//! because the model cache is channel-independent: a released build and a dev
//! build share one directory, so a process-local "currently loaded" flag cannot
//! see the other one's `prune`. **Load** is the pair of a lease and an engine
//! check, and is what an engine adapter is handed.
//!
//! ## A lease is released by dropping it
//!
//! There is deliberately no `release()`. A lease is a `Box<dyn ModelLease>`
//! whose implementation does its work in `Drop`, so the only way to hold one is
//! to hold it and the only way to let go is to stop — which means an inference
//! thread that panics releases its lease, and so does one that returns early
//! down a path nobody wrote a cleanup for. An explicit `release` would be
//! correct at every call site until the first one that was not.
//!
//! ## None of this may run on a thread that answers a person
//!
//! [`ModelStore::install`] downloads hundreds of megabytes and hashes them;
//! [`ModelStore::lease`] takes a cross-process lock; even
//! [`ModelStore::installed`] walks directories. All of them are *the world*, in
//! the sense [PRINCIPLES](../../../guide/contributing/PRINCIPLES.md) means it, and the window's
//! frame loop and the agent's event loop may call none of them. The worker's
//! inference thread is where they belong.
