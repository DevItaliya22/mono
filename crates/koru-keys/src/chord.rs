//! A chord: one key, plus the modifiers held with it.
//!
//! This is the shape every resolver in the tree already has, written once. The
//! editor's `input::keymap` has carried its own copy — with a `ctrl: bool` that
//! secretly meant *primary* — and the other three resolvers spell the same
//! thing out inline in `if` chains.
//!
//! ## Two platform traps that live in [`On::Letter`]
//!
//! Both were real bugs, and both are why a chord is matched through a function
//! rather than compared to a `Key`:
//!
//! - **Ctrl+I arrives as `NamedKey::Tab`** on Windows. [`letter`] maps it back,
//!   so `Ctrl+I` can mean italic while a bare `Tab` still indents.
//! - **Ctrl+letter arrives as an ASCII control code**, not a character: Ctrl+K
//!   is `0x0B`. [`letter`] maps both encodings to the letter.
