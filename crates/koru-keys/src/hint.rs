//! Advertising a chord — **the one seam every printed shortcut goes through**.
//!
//! A hint is a chord written down where somebody can read it: the trailing
//! column of a menu row, the second line of a tooltip, the heading of the panel
//! a chord opens. It is not the binding. [`Chord`](crate::Chord) is what a key
//! press is matched against; [`Hinted`] is what a surface *prints*, and the two
//! are different jobs with different failure modes.
//!
//! ## Why one function
//!
//! Two reasons, and the second is the one this module exists for.
//!
//! **A printed chord must be the bound chord.** The literals came first — 77 of
//! them in the document's menus alone, every one wrong on macOS — and
//! `registry::label_of` fixed those by rendering from the table. The remaining
//! literals were in tooltips, which nothing had swept: four in the container's
//! caption said `Ctrl+…` on a Mac. Going through [`show_hint`] with a
//! [`ShortcutId`] means the label cannot drift from the binding, because there
//! is only one of them.
//!
//! **And hints have to be switchable.** Somebody who knows the app does not
//! need every menu row teaching them a chord they typed to open the menu; a
//! screenshot does not want them; a demo may want only the tooltips. That is a
//! decision about a *class* of hint rather than about one row, so it cannot live
//! at a call site — which is why every call site asks here first, and why the
//! answer is `Option<String>` rather than a `String` a caller could draw anyway.
//!
//! ```
//! # use koru_keys::{Section, ShortcutId, show_hint};
//! if let Some(text) = show_hint(ShortcutId::NewTab, Section::Tooltip) {
//!     // draw `text` — and nothing at all when hints are off
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Registering
//!
//! **Every chord this app binds belongs in [`REGISTRY`](crate::REGISTRY)**, and
//! anything new — written by a person or by an agent — goes in the table rather
//! than into a string at a call site. The collision test only sees what is in
//! the table, so an unregistered binding is one nothing checks, and a
//! hand-written label is one nothing keeps in step with the platform.
//!
//! [`Hinted::Literal`] is for a chord the *platform* owns. A handful of app
//! bindings still use it because registering them needs table changes rather
//! than table rows — they are named in `docs/contributing/techdebt/README.md`.
