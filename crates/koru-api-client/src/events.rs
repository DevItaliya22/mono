//! `client.events()` — the events namespace: publish, read, subscribe.
//!
//! The bus is cross-process by construction: every process that can open a
//! [`crate::Client`] — koru.exe, the Agent, koru-mcp, an external tool — uses
//! exactly this surface, riding the same gateway session and renewal the
//! store calls do. The model (`koru_events`) validates before a byte moves;
//! the worker validates again on the other side, because the wire is a
//! public boundary.
//!
//! **Delivery semantics, plainly:** [`EventsClient::on`] is at-least-once
//! *within the process lifetime* — a background thread tails the SSE stream,
//! resumes reconnects gap-free through its cursor, and loses its place only
//! when the process dies. Anything needing durable resumption uses
//! [`EventsClient::read`] with a cursor the caller persists. The handler runs
//! on the subscription's thread, one delivery at a time and in cursor order;
//! forwarding into a UI loop follows the house "send first, wake second"
//! rule, and a handler panic kills only its subscription.
