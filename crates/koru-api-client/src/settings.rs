//! `client.settings()` — the typed namespace every window uses.
//!
//! **A window must never wait on its settings to draw.** The bounded wait
//! below is the whole reason this namespace has a shape beyond "read and
//! patch": a window asks for a section, gets the registry's defaults back
//! immediately, renders, and swaps in the authoritative values when they land.
//! If the Gateway does not answer within [`koru_settings::STARTUP_WAIT_MILLIS`]
//! the window stays on defaults — never a hang, and never a splash screen
//! while somebody's editor waits on a preferences file.
//!
//! **A write needs a scope a default token does not hold.** `settings.write`
//! is out of the ordinary default set, so a caller that intends to change
//! settings names it at connect time:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let client = koru_api_client::Client::ensure_with_scopes(
//!     "internal-debug",
//!     &[
//!         koru_settings::SETTINGS_READ_SCOPE,
//!         koru_settings::SETTINGS_WRITE_SCOPE,
//!     ],
//! )?;
//! let global = client.settings().global()?;
//! # let _ = global;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Asking for scopes *filters* rather than adds, so a caller that names these
//! two holds only these two — name every scope the process needs in one call.
