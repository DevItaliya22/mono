//! ## Ids, not names
//!
//! Nothing here carries a profile. **A profile is an authorization and query
//! scope over workspaces**, resolved through the store's catalog before a query
//! reaches this crate; an index that stored one would be storing a fact about
//! who is allowed to look rather than a fact about what is written. Scope
//! arrives as a set of workspace ids.
//!
//! ## Tokens, not labels
//!
//! [`Field`] is `heading-2`, not `"Heading 2"`. The old index stored the
//! English and ranked on it, which made every result label untranslatable and
//! froze the vocabulary of the surface into the schema. *Persist semantic
//! values, never translated labels* — the same rule onboarding follows for a
//! purpose and an avatar ([ADR-82](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-076-100.md#adr-82-i18n--internationalization-constrains-what-is-stored-not-how-it-is-shown)).
//! Whoever draws a result resolves the label.

// **The wire vocabulary lives in `koru-store-wire`**, and is re-exported here so

// need to name a hit — the daemon that builds one, the HTTP layer that
// serialises it, the blocking client that parses it — and only this one should
// link an FTS engine to do so.
