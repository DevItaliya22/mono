//!
//! ## What this crate does not know
//!
//! **There is no `koru-core` in its manifest and no type from it in its
//! source.** The projection is strings and primitives precisely so that a
//! consumer does not acquire an opinion about what a `Kind::ListBlock` is;
//! everything here works from `koru-projection`'s model and `rusqlite`.
//!
//! **There is no profile.** A profile is an authorization and query scope over
//! *workspaces*, resolved through the store's catalog before a query arrives.
//! An index that stored one would be storing a fact about who may look rather
//! than about what is written.
//!
//! ## Disposable, and enumerable
//!
//! Deleting `search.db` must be safe. It is rebuilt by comparing the index's
//! own cursors against the projection — the same comparison that catches a
//! document projected while the indexer was stopped, so the repair path and the
//! ordinary path are one piece of code.
//!
//! ## The obligation this crate carries
//!
//! **Ask for a sweep before trusting a workspace.** The projector follows the
//! store's laziness: a restarted store does not re-project a workspace until
//! something uses it. Nothing is stale that anybody has written to; what is
//! stale is a workspace nobody has touched since the store came up — which is
//! exactly the workspace a query is about to ask about. [`Search::query`] does
//! this. Skipping it is quiet: results from before the restart, and no error
//! anywhere.
