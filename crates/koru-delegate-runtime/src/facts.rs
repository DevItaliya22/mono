//! The facts a run publishes — what P1.8 turns into `delegate.*` rows.
//!
//! A closed enum mirroring §7.5's timeline rows plus the lifecycle, control
//! and economics facts of §7.4 and §17. Every variant is ids, counts, times
//! and closed vocabularies, and serializes as the body a pending
//! publication stores (§7.1's queue) — so a fact is the same bytes on the
//! first send and on every retry, and the journal dedupes on the
//! [`koru_delegate_core::EventId`] the orchestrator minted for it.
//!
//! **A fact carries what its row needs.** The body in the queue is what a
//! re-publication after a restart is rebuilt from, so anything the event
//! row spells has to be *in* the fact: the attempt generation, the
//! overlap a busy start proceeded onto, the code an attachment was refused
//! with. Re-deriving those from the ledger at retry time would read
//! whatever is true *then* — a resumed run has a later generation than the
//! interruption that is still queued — and publish a row that was never
//! true. What a fact does not carry is what never changes: a run's asker,
//! agent and scope kind come from the creation intent, which is written
//! once and never rewritten.
//!
//! **Nothing here can carry text.** No variant has a `String`, an
//! objective, a title, a path or a note; the one closed-vocabulary field a
//! fact carries beyond ids and counts is a stage, a reason, an outcome or
//! an originator from the run vocabulary.
//! `crates/koru-delegate-runtime/src/tests/privacy.rs` feeds a sentinel
//! objective through a whole run and asserts it is in no fact.
