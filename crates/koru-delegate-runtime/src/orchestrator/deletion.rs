//! **Deleting a run**: into the trash, back out of it, and the empty.
//!
//! Three verbs, and the split between them and the window is the whole
//! shape of the feature.
//!
//! A run *is* a Run document in the workspace's manifest, so putting one in
//! the trash is that document's move into the workspace's bin — reversible,
//! synced, and exactly what happens to every other document in Koru
//! (ADR-69). That move is a manifest edit and the manifest belongs to the
//! window. What only this worker can do is the rest: refuse a run that is
//! still working, remember what the person said about its results, and — on
//! the empty — remove everything device-local that the run left behind.
//!
//! So each verb here answers with the document, and the window moves it.
//!
//! **The empty is ordered so nothing is half-deleted.** The working folder
//! goes first, because it is the only step that can be refused by something
//! outside Koru; a refusal changes nothing else and the run stays in the
//! trash, where it can be deleted again. Then the results, if the person
//! asked for them to go. Then the authority record, then the ledger's rows,
//! then — back in the window — the document.
//!
//! **And the folder is removed only when Koru made it.**
//! [`koru_delegate_scope::remove_working_folder`] is the one place that is
//! decided, from the scope the ledger recorded at creation. A run scoped to
//! a project root ran *inside the person's own repository*; the run is
//! forgotten and that directory is left exactly alone, and
//! [`koru_delegate_core::FolderOutcome::Kept`] is what the trash tells them
//! it did rather than saying nothing.
