//! Resume — the fresh attempt after an interruption (§7.6, D10, D48).
//!
//! A person asks; nothing resumes a run on its own. In order, because each
//! step is what the next one relies on:
//!
//! 1. the run must be `Interrupted` — a run that is running is reattached
//!    to, not resumed;
//! 2. an interruption whose prior attempt is *unknown* (§7.6's last row)
//!    needs the person's explicit `confirm`, because they are told earlier
//!    work may exist. **It is not evidence** — nothing a person says proves
//!    an unobserved provider stopped, and the fence below is what does;
//! 3. D48's admission runs over the **original pins**: a source now in the
//!    trash or gone refuses the resume with its stable code, and no key is
//!    retired for a resume that will not happen;
//! 4. the previous attempt's creation key is **retired at the host before
//!    the next generation opens**, so a delayed create under it is refused,
//!    and a key found live is reattached to, never resumed past;
//! 5. the adapter's resume seam is asked. A token continues the provider
//!    session (`Native`); its absence is the recorded-context fallback
//!    (`RecordedContext`) — a fresh session whose first submission is the
//!    preamble, the objective and a bounded list of the artifacts registered
//!    so far. **The timeline says which.**
//!
//! The pins are the original ones (§7.2: *resume keeps the original pins*),
//! so `begin_attempt` re-materializes exactly what the header names. The
//! captures themselves are untouched — run cleanup removes materialized
//! copies, never captures — so nothing is captured a second time.
