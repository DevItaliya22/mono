//! The ports: what the orchestrator needs from a host, as traits.
//!
//! Each port is one seam a host fills — the ledger, the Run document, the
//! session host, context capture, the event bus, the preamble, the scope
//! roots, the MCP endpoint, artifact registrations, and the two clocks —
//! and each has a fake in `src/tests/mod.rs`. Two of them are deliberately
//! shaped for a plan running in parallel: [`ContextCapture`] is P1.7's to
//! fill and [`RunEvents`] is P1.8's; the fakes pin every item and record
//! every fact so this crate's tests do not wait for either.
//!
//! **Every port error is a [`PortError`]**: which port, a stable code and
//! a safe detail. The ledger's own `LedgerError` converts into one, so the
//! orchestrator branches on codes and a log line names a port — never a
//! path, an objective or a provider payload.
